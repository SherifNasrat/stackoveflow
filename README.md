## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using StackOverflow survey results data from 2013 to 2019 to know which programming languages or technologies that are used the most every year and see how that changes from one year to the next as well as the number of new technologies that emerged over the years.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
__Helper.py:__ This file contains helper methods for reading the data from csv files, plotting the charts and so on.
__StackOverFlow.py:__ This is the main code used, feel free to use it as you wish.
There are 7 folders each containing a dataset for a certain year from Stackoveflow.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@SherifNasrat/one-programming-language-to-rule-them-all-a31d2ac9a526).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
